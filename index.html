    <p>When I worked fast food my first night on drive-through a man came through for a fish sandwich and a white coffee as I said, “Excuse me?” My manager breezed past saying, “I got this." We expected him Monday, Wednesday, and Friday!

        One Monday he didn't show up even though we watched for his car. Wednesday still he didn't show. By Friday we were frantic watching every car that even slowed down near the entrance -- still he didn't come. To be honest, we were so used to him we worried constantly that something was wrong but of course we didn't have a way to find him either.
        
        Monday came around and an unfamiliar car pulls into drive-through, “I need a fish sandwich and a white coffee." My manager came barreling out of her office to the drive-through window! It turns out after stopping for his usual a few Fridays back, he was in a car accident and was without a vehicle for awhile. I would be lying if I didn't say we shed a few tears of joy knowing he was OK! We loved our regulars!</p>

    <p style="color: silver;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have designed a few programming languages .jan 30 </p>
        <h4>Do you believe it is ever a good idea to use a GOTO in a C/C++ program, why?</h4>
        <p> First, check out “Zahn's Device” (Wikipedia calls this “Zahn's Construct”). This will take you back to this ancient controversy, and some interesting work arounds.</p>
        <p>I started as a machine code programmer in the early 60s, and gotos (JMPs) were very much used.

            It's worth looking at the voluminous machine code listings of the Apollo Guidance Computer, and reflect that they *never* had an actual software bug in the history of the moon shots (the famous glitch on the moon landing was a procedure error by an astronaut, and the software actually was able to fail-safe the error in real-time).
            
            The issues about whether to use them in higher level languages that had more structured ways to change flows of control, revolved not around the goto itself, but about whether at any given point in a program a programmer could have an accurate picture of the current state of the variables. Most gotos were written so as not to create mysteries at the other end of things — in other words, the goto was not so much of the problem as the “where from” questions in the midst of code.
            
            The many kinds of race conditions often led to really careful programmers not assigning to the same variable more than once in a loop, etc.
            
            The biggest problem with “taking care” and then letting time pass, is that the exact reasons why something is OK get forgotten, and changes often “don't take the same care”.
            
            Then there is the observation of Tony Hoare (Turing Laureate) that “Debugging is harder than programming, so don't use up all your cleverness programming”.
            
            When programming is looked at longitudinally, it looks (and is) often really bad. One reason for high level languages is to deal with “the programmer problem” by walling off dangerous stuff wherever possible (this will include not just control, but storage management, etc.). This should nowadays exclude most sequential “munge-variable” programming, and dangerous control constructs such as “goto”.</p>
